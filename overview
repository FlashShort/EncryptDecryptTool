An overview for reference.

With R, develop a secure file encryption and decryption tool with a simple gui that will allow a user to encrypt and decrypt files securely.

Will implement a symmetric-key encryption algorithm, AES. 

Features:

1. File Encryption

Users can select a file to encrypt using an encryption key.
Key management and secure handle.

2. File Decryption

Users can decrypt the encrypted file using the key.
Process is secure/reliable.

3. Key Generation

Users can generate encryption key/s of specified lengths.
Implement random number generation algorithm for key generation.

4. Password-Based Encryption

Use of passphrase for encryp/decryption (optional for user).
Enforce strong and complex policy.

5. Secure File Deletion

Secure deletion, sensitive data is properly erased.

5. GUI

Must be clean and simple.

6. Documentation

How to use, examples, information on encryption and the best way to use.

Considerations:

-Error handling.
-Sensitive information is never stored in plain text, use a one way hash.
-File integrity checks to verify authenticity. HMAC? Something else?
-Use KDFs to protect against brute-force.
-Use a limiter for passphrase.
-IVs for each encryption operation to prevent patterns in the ciphertext.

Further Thought:

-User activity logging....
